        <h2>White Space / Clean Design</h2>
        <a href="https://wovenstore.com/">Woven Store.</a>
        <p>The lack of busy graphics and colors in the background give this website a clean and simple feel to it. It helps to draw more attention to both the logo and the images. </p>

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <a href="https://www.ringba.com/">Ringba</a>
        <p>The dark background has made it a lot easier to bring contrast into its design. There is a big emphasis on the 'GET A DEMO' button which we can easily see from the stark white color.  </p>

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>
        <p>Many elements of this website are aligned which helps unify the page. The robot image, the logo, all of the form information, and some of the text below all have the same starting and ending point.</p>
